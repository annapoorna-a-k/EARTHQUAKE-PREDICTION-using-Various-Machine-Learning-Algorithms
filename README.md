## Earthquake-Prediction-using-Python
### Introduction
Earthquake Prediction is a way of predicting the magnitude of an earthquake based on parameters such as longitude, latitude, depth, and duration magnitude, country, and depth using machine learning to give warnings of potentially damaging earthquakes early enough to allow appropriate response to the disaster, enabling people to minimize loss of life and property.
